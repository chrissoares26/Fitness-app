# Overview

This is a simple swift project that I am developing for a friend that is a personal trainer. It is supposed to be offered as a free service in order to gather the lead information, since the personal trainer offers a full online course. 

It teaches a stretching routine, for every week day, and it also has a tab that contains the personal trainer's contact information.

Here is a link with a quick walkthrough of the app.
